//Parts of a form must haves: 
//<form>, <input> and usually a <button> </button></form>value={this.state.whateverthisiscalled} type='whatever type this is' name='' //onChange='whatever you call this'
//onSubmit - this is used for when the form is submitted
//computed properties - we need this to have multiple inputs in our forms. We don't need separate onChange handlers for every single input and can make a gerneric function for multiple inputs - our inputs need to have an exact name that is in state
//you need to put a 'name' property on all 'inputs' if you have multiple inputs. This allows state to change based on inputs. Name must match what's in state.
//in handleChange use computed properties to have access to all the input states. 
// handleChange = e => {
//     // update state with each keystroke
//     this.setState({
//       [e.target.name]: e.target.value
//      });
//    };

//label is for forms (acessibility)
//<label htmlFor="username"></label> ---------> for needs to match id on input id="username"

//Passing Data Up to A Parent Component
//In React we generally have downward data flow. 'Smart' parent components with simpler child components 

//you need to map 

//add item is a method that is passed from parent to this form
